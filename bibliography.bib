    abstract = {The Split algorithm is an essential building block of route-first cluster-second heuristics and modern genetic algorithms for vehicle routing problems. The algorithm is used to partition a solution, represented as a giant tour without occurrences of the depot, into separate routes with minimum cost. As highlighted by the recent survey of Prins et al. [18], no less than 70 recent articles use this technique. In the vehicle routing literature, Split is usually assimilated to the search for a shortest path in a directed acyclic graph G and solved in O(nB) using Bellman׳s algorithm, where n is the number of delivery points and B is the average number of feasible routes that start with a given customer in the giant tour. Some linear-time algorithms are also known for this problem as a consequence of a Monge property of G. In this paper, we highlight a stronger property of this graph, leading to a simple alternative algorithm in O(n). Experimentally, we observe that the approach is faster than the classical Split for problem instances of practical size. We also extend the method to deal with a limited fleet and soft capacity constraints.},

    abstract = {The recent research on the CVRP is being slowed down by the lack of a good set of benchmark instances. The existing sets suffer from at least one of the following drawbacks: (i) became too easy for current algorithms; (ii) are too artificial; (iii) are too homogeneous, not covering the wide range of characteristics found in real applications. We propose a new set of 100 instances ranging from 100 to 1000 customers, designed in order to provide a more comprehensive and balanced experimental setting. Moreover, the same generating scheme was also used to provide an extended benchmark of 600 instances. In addition to having a greater discriminating ability to identify “which algorithm is better”, these new benchmarks should also allow for a deeper statistical analysis of the performance of an algorithm. In particular, they will enable one to investigate how the characteristics of an instance affect its performance. We report such an analysis on state-of-the-art exact and heuristic methods.},
